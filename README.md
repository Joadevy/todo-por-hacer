## Overview
This is my second project after learning in depth some concepts of the javascript language. I've created it so as to put the knowledge into practice because it's the way to acquire and really understand the things I've learned before. I chose a to-do list project because it has a lot of features to think about and interesting concepts to apply in. The features that this app has are:
- Saving tasks in local storage.
- Enter tasks with 'enter' key and with button create (validating before if there isn't an empty task)
- Edit tasks in the task-menu.
- Remove tasks in the task-menu.
- Clear all tasks by filter (all - pending - completed)

### The challenge
Basically consists in a todo list aplying concepts of HTML/CSS/JS. I had to think how to do the differents features that I wanted to implement and It was a bit difficult at the beggining because there were several dependencies to handle. Finally when everything went in the correct way I enjoyed working on it, although bugs have always appeared but I was able to fix them. I'm proud with my work and I like it.

## My process
I've chosen the idea by recommendation in a twitch stream of a really good developer and teacher [@goncy](https://www.twitch.tv/goncypozzo). Then I thought about all the logic of the app by myself so probably it's not the most optimal way to do it but it works (I assure you). Finally I put in practice my CSS skills once again to design the web and make it visually atractive.

### Built with

- Desktop first workflow
- Responsive design
- Flexbox/Grid concepts
- Control version system using Git
- JavaScript vanilla

### What I learned
In this project I learned quite more than the previous. I used local storage to save the data of the tasks entered by the user and I had to use different array methods to be able to do the features that I wanted. It was a challenge to make everything work well but I started with an idea and I was be able to get it. I'll keep working and improving on it.

### Continued development
I'm really excited to keep learning about frontend technologies, specially more about javascript in order to create dynamic webs and amazing web-experiences.
